It is a fortran code to generate length vs time trajectory for a single actin filament undergoing polymerization, severing and hydrolysis. Three microscopic monomer states are there, namely ADP-pi (denoted by +1 value in the code), ADP (denoted by 0 value in the code), and ADP-cof (denoted by -1 value in the code).
Details are commented in the code, along with the parameter values.
To successfully run the code, you need gfortran as the compiler.
